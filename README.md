# ROB498-Trajectory-Optimization
The final project of Umich ROB 498: Robot Learning for Planning and Control. In this project, we study the control of a double inverted pendulum on a cart(DIPC) system using different model based trajectory
optimization algorithms - Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). 

## Installation
To install the required environment and packages, we recommend to use Anaconda and run the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate venv 
```

## Running the code

```bash
python main.py
